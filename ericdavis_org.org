- Back at it on another beautiful Saturday. Just spent the last 15
  minutes going back over the codebase. That's the downside of this
  really being a weekend project: It takes time to get back up to
  speed. I'm going to try John Resig's approach soon of working on it
  30 minutes every day.
- I'm going without coffee this morning. First time in years. Curious
  to see if/how it effects me. I can already feel the headache
  creeping up.
- Decided I don't like the native OPML editing. Or, at least, not how
  it works currently. Going back to a system where I edit Org files
  while OPML is just a transport to XSLT.
- Worknotes:
  - Formatting of bold, italics and monospace in list items still
    doesn't work like I want but in the interest of not spending an
    entire morning on it I'm going to move on.
  - Merged the org-opml-item fixes into org-opml's master branch. Left
    in the =structure= stuff, as it's not hurting anything and is
    required to roundtrip successfully. Though I will have to
    re-evaluate how everything there fits together one of these days.
  - Added a =created= attribute to this post.

Been working all morning on the currently untitled opml-xslt
project. Really do need to come up with a name for it.

This is a brand new entry. I'm curious how completely fresh content
will look. Most everything created so far was tailored to fit the CMS,
but with this, I'm treating it like the CMS is done and I'm just
creating a new entry fresh. As you can probably tell, I'm getting
long-winded because I also want to see how longer paragraphs look.

I need to figure out what to do with the timestamps. Maybe go back to
"created" attribute while putting a "last built" in a footer.

- The created attribute is now used instead of document.lastModified.
  - Nothing is displayed if no created attribute exists.

Cleaned up the XSL templates. Removed all the &lt;xsl:attribute>
elements I could in favor of directly setting the path attribute. Also
started using &lt;xsl:variable>.

Changed how PROPERTIES is displayed on the OPML. Now a more subtle
DarkSlateGrey for the keyword face and a brightish white for the
value. Looks pretty good.

The main reason I wanted to build this system was to quickly jot down
notes and then easily share them with the world.

Other static HTML generators exist, but none of them worked exactly
how I wanted.

I find the idea of an “outliner as a CMS” to be amazing. I didn't want
to maintain a directory full of Markdown files. I want to maintain
structure and navigation through nested outlines. It just feels more
natural this way.

Another thing I want to explore tomorrow is including raw CDATA of Org
mode export blocks as the content of an &lt;outline> element.

- I like how this is turning out. XSLT is such a natural fit for what
  I'm trying to do I'm surprised I hadn't thought of it earlier.
  - Actually, I think I did. Though not like this.

A noteblog differs from a regular blog in that it doesn't require
titles.

I'm using ul/li tags to give the base structure to it all.

I think I need to step back for a bit and map out how it all fits
together. Too often I dive right in with code without giving enough
thought to how everything fits together. As a result, the results come
out subpar.

- It's kind of crazy to think how many moving pieces I've managed to
  fit together:
  - Emacs provides the editing/programming environment
  - Org mode is the interface that edits the docs
  - OPML to translate Org mode style files to an XML dialect for
    outlines
  - XSLT translates the OPML to an intermediary XML format. This is
    needed as creating multiple files isn't supported in XSLT 1.0
    which is what xsltproc uses.
  - Python takes the XML file and generates the HTML files

And just like that, I converted a note post into an outline
post. Woo-hoo!

A collection of TODO items for Rushmore as I think of them.

    - The generated XML file is now split by =process_collection=
      inside =dodo.py=
    - Transform GMT =created= timestamp to local time with moment.js
      for ease of reading.
    - ericdavis.org now has an [[/rss.xml][RSS feed]]
